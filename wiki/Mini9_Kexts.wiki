#summary This is a list of all kexts installed with DellEFI and their uses

= Dell Mini 9 Custom Kexts and their uses =

|| *Kext* || *Use* || *Reason for inclusion* || *Future Plans* ||
|| AppleACPIPS2Nub.kext || Provides an interface to the PS2Controller kext to enable and dissable interupts || Apple has discontinued support for PS2 devices in 10.5 Leopard || ||
|| AppleDecrypt.kext || || || ||
|| AppleIntelGMA950.kext || Driver for the GMA950 display || Only change is that it has been patched (read hex edited) so that it recognizes 0x27AE as a supported device || Make a script (using tr / sed) to patch the driver when dellEFI is run, that way we are not distributing apple code that has not been released, also reduces download size. The script will also make it so that the latest driver is always used. ||
|| AppleIntelIntegratedFramebuffer.kext || framebuffer stuff for the intel cards || Only change is that it has been patched (read hex edited) so that it recognizes 0x27AE as a supported device || Make a script (using tr / sed) to patch the driver when dellEFI is run, that way we are not distributing apple code that has not been released, also reduces download size. The script will also make it so that the latest driver is always used. ||
|| AppleIntelPIIXATA.kext || PATA driver || If I remember correctly, this driver also allows sleep / resume to work correctly || ||
|| ApplePS2Controller.kext || Driver for PS2 Devices, includes keyboard and trackpad kexts || Needed to enable keyboard and trackpad || ||
|| AppleRTL8169Ethernet.kext || || || ||
|| IO80211Family.kext || || || ||
|| IOGraphicsFamily.kext || || Driver needed so that IONDRVSupport will load || ||
|| IONDRVSupport.kext || Framebuffer stuff... || This driver  (From 10.4.7) enables QE/CI || ||
|| IONetworkingFamily.kext || || || ||
|| IOSDHCIBlockDevice.kext || Jmicron SDHC driver || Min 9 includes a card reader, this driver enables it || ||
|| Natit.kext || Injects the display info into the ioregister || Used to enable GMA950 driver usage ||  Can be replaced with an efi strin (also boots a second ot two faster w/ the string) ||
|| SMBIOSResolver.kext || || || ||

= Dell Mini 9 Custom LocalExtensions kexts and their uses =
Quick qestions... Why are these not in the /Extra/Extensions1 folder?
|| AppleHDA.kext || HD Audio kext || || Why is this a "LocalExtensions" and not installed in the Extra/ directory? ||
|| ClamshellDisplay.kext || Enables sleep when display is closed || Add glue so that sleep works properly || This should probably be moved to the /Extra folder instead of /S/L/E/ ||
|| HDAEnabler.kext || This kext `injects` the soundcard into the device tree so that it can be used by the AppleHDa driver|| Enables the sound by allowing AppleHDA associate with it. || This can (read: should) be replaced with an efi string. Also, using an efi string may negate the need for the IOAudioFamily kext (I have replaced it with an efi string) ||
|| IOAudioFamily.kext || Provides an interface for audio drivers || The kext has been patched so that audio works on resume. || Why is this a "LocalExtensions" and not installed in the Extra/ director? ||
