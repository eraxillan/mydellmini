= Dell Mini 9 Custom LocalExtensions kexts and their uses =
Quick qestions... Why are these not in the /Extra/Extensions1 folder?
|| AppleHDA.kext || HD Audio kext || || Why is this a "LocalExtensions" and not installed in the Extra/ directory? ||
|| ClamshellDisplay.kext || Enables sleep when display is closed || Add glue so that sleep works properly || ||
|| HDAEnabler.kext || This kext `injects` the soundcard into the device tree so that it can be used by the AppleHDa driver|| Enables the sound by allowing AppleHDA associate with it. || This can (read: should) be replaced with an efi string. Also, using an efi string may negate the need for the IOAudioFamily kext ||
|| IOAudioFamily.kext || Provides an interface for audio drivers || The kext has been patched so that audio works on resume. || Why is this a "LocalExtensions" and not installed in the Extra/ director? ||
